# [Residual Spatial Attention Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation(ICONIP2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08829)
This code is for the paper: Residual Spatial Attention Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation. We report state-of-the-art performances on DRIVE and CHASE DB1 datasets.

Code written by Changlu Guo, Budapest University of Technology and Economics(BME).


We train and evaluate on Ubuntu 16.04, it will also work for Windows and OS.

## Quick start 

Train:
Run train_drive.py or train_chase.py

Test:
Run eval_drive.py or eval_chase.py

## Results
